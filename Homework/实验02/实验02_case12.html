                <p style="font-weight:bold">Talk Title: NLP for Microblog Summarization</p>
                <p>Massive volume of textual information, eg news, over the Internet results in the problem of information explosion. 
                    Direct reading of massive text is impractical if not incomprehensible. For this reason, there is a growing demand 
                    for automatic summarization technology in the digital era. Traditionally, the goal of automatic summarization is 
                    to identify relevant excerpts from the target document(s), digest them and represent them in a succinct form for 
                    easy reading. While research in summarization has been in good progress in past decades, its effectiveness has been 
                    proved extremely low for social media applications, such as microblogging in twitter, WeChat, etc. This is mainly 
                    due to word limitation of microblog messages, which in turn leads to lack of proper grammatical structures and 
                    discourse information. We investigate how conventional NLP techniques can be best applied to summarizing microblogs.
                     Resembling a document in a traditional natural language text, we first cluster related microblogs to form a microblog
                      document (m-doc). Within a m-doc, microblog paragraphs (m-para) are formed by the leading topics. Practically, 
                      a m-para is a microblog re-post tree. Each m-para is comprised of inter-related short microblog messages ('sentences'),
                       which is referred to as m-sent. Also, links between m-sent and m-para are viewed as contextual information. 
                       In our research, we propose a new discourse integration technique over m-doc for microblog summarization purpose.

                <p style="font-weight:bold">Talk Title: Will Question Answering Become the Main Theme of IR Research?</p>
                <p>Abstract: In the era of mobile internet, question answering (QA) is becoming a more popular way for users to perform information access. 
                     For example, users want to get information more naturally and quickly through question answering on mobile 
                    phones; users in a specific domain want to get more precise and helpful advice in their decision making 
                    through question answering from knowledge base in the domain. Traditionally, a QA system is built upon search 
                    technologies. I argue in this talk that this is not sufficient for meeting the needs of users with regard to
                     QA at present and in the future. I discuss several important yet unsolved QA problems for research in the field
                     of IR, including Generative QA, Robust QA, and Interactive QA. I will also introduce some of our work on QA 
                    conducted at Huawei Noah Ark Lab.</p>

                <p style="font-weight:bold">Talk Title: New Ways of Thinking about Search with New Devices
                </p>
                <p>Abstract: With the introduction of new types of devices in our everyday lives (e.g. smart phones, smart watches, smart glasses, etc.), the interfaces over which IR systems are used are becoming increasingly smaller, which limits the interactions users may have. Searching over devices with such small interfaces is not easy as it requires more effort to type and interact with such systems. Hence, building IR systems that can reduce the interactions needed with the device is highly critical. 
 
Design, optimization and evaluation of retrieval systems has traditionally focused on identifying and retrieving documents relevant to a query submitted by the user. However, with the new devices over which search engines are used for, effort to find relevant information plays a significant role for user satisfaction. In this talk, I will first argue that effort to find relevant information in a document can have a significant impact on user satisfaction, arguing that more research should be put into devising retrieval methods that aim at minimizing user effort, given a query.
 
Ideally, a search engine should be able to understand the reason that caused the user to submit a query and it should help the user achieve the actual task by guiding her through the steps (or subtasks) that need to be completed. Devising such task based information retrieval systems have several challenges that have to be tackled. In the second part of this talk, I will focus on the problems that need to be solved when designing such systems, as well as the progress that we have made in these areas.</p>
